### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Beksultan. Experienced in Ruby on Rails, JavaScript, Redux, CSS, HTML, SQLite and React based programming, I am a diligent worker possessing strong skills in writing clean code, problem solving, and learning new technologies. Recently I've successfully completed a Full-Stack Software Engineering program at Flatiron School, which expanded my creative tools and enhanced my backend and frontend skills. I learned how to work with databases, interactive designs and other essential features of a functional web application. I am now eager to launch my career as a junior software developer. Open to relocate or work remotely.
